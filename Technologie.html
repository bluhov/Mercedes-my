                    <h3>Responds to danger, before you're in it.</h3>
                    For decades, the S-Class has predicted the 
                    safety standards of the future. Today's S-Class 
                    literally looks ahead, and 360 degrees around, 
                    to spot hazards in your path. A team of 
                    standard and optional systems can alert the driver, 
                    assist in braking, and even respond autonomously to help
                     avoid collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians.

                    Dual 12.3-inch high-resolution screens combine
                     the clarity of analog-style instruments with 
                    lifelike animated displays of driving systems,
                     vehicle settings, entertainment and navigation.
                     A console-mounted touchpad makes the advanced COMAND®
                     system intuitive to use, so even the most innovative 
                    features quickly feel like like second nature.
